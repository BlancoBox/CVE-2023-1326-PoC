# CVE-2023-1326-PoC
A proof of concept for CVE-2023–1326 in apport-cli 2.26.0

I have included the steps to create and terminate a process and generate a crash file to assist in the initial Proof of Concept (POC) [reference: https://medium.com/@yurytechx/devvortex-writeup-hack-the-box-605d60f2d5ef].

This vulnerability is privilege escalation in apport-cli 2.26.0, similar to CVE-2023–26604, this vulnerability only works if assign in sudoers:

A privilege escalation attack was found in apport-cli 2.26.0 and earlier which is similar to CVE-2023-26604. If a system is specially configured to allow unprivileged users to run sudo apport-cli, less is configured as the pager, and the terminal size can be set: a local attacker can escalate privilege.
